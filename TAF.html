	<h1>Target Analyte Finding</h1>
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p class="content_text">Target Analyte Finding (TAF) is one of two data processing tools 
	that has the capability of finding analytes within a sample.  TAF is a data processing 
	technique which searches for a predefined set of analytes in a sample.  The other method 
	for finding peaks in a sample is Peak Finding which is used primarily for discovery work.  
	Each technique has a specific purpose, and associated <a target="_blank" href="PF_vs_TAF.html">
	advantages and disadvantages</a>.</p>
	
	<p class="content_text">Because TAF is a targeted method of finding peaks in a sample the 
	user must know the elution time and spectral properties of the targeted analytes.  The 
	following set of instructions describes the steps of creating and utilizing a TAF data 
	processing method for both 1D & GCxGC samples.</p>

				<li class="content_text"><strong>Manual Analyte Addition</strong>
					<p>To manually create the list of analytes to be targeted, begin by clicking the Add button 
					which will create a new analyte row.  Then, in the analyte column provide a name for the 
					analyte.  Next, define the retention time window the analyte is expected to be found in by 
					providing a Start and End time.  Then, define the Isotopes which will be used to find each 
					analyte within a given retention time window.  Click the advanced button which will prompt the 
					window to input Isotopes.  Within this window click the Add button, and provide the chemical 
					formula for the Isotopes you would like the software to target for a given analyte.  Upon 
					adding a chemical formula for a given fragment the software will automatically add the most 
					abundant isotopes and calculate their neutral masses.  Formula entry is case sensitive.</p>

				<li class="content_text"><strong>Adding Targeted Analytes from a Processed Sample</strong>
					<p>A more efficient method to add targeted analytes to a DP method is by automatically adding 
					analytes from a sample that has already been processed.  This is accomplished by selecting 
					the targeted analytes from the peak table, right clicking, and selecting Add Selected Peaks 
					to/TAF Methodâ€¦ When using this technique the retention time range will be created around the 
					absolute R.T. of the selected analyte based upon the user defined full width at half height 
					multiplier.  Targeted ions will be selected from the peak true, based upon the relative 
					abundance threshold defined by the user.</p>

				<li class="content_text"><strong>Adding Targeted Analytes from a Library</strong>
					<p>Another efficient way to add targeted analytes to a data processing method, is by 
					selecting them from a library.  The user can select analytes previously added to a 
					<a target="_blank" href="Libraries_UserCreated.html">User Created Library</a> or from 
					the <a target="_blank" href="Libraries_TargetSearch.html">TargetSearch</a> library.  
					Please note, this will not work using a commercially available library such as the NIST.  
					From the TAF tab within the DP method select the library button, define which library, 
					and then select the targeted analytes.  The retention time range and ions within the 
					library for the selected analyte will automatically added to the list of targeted analytes.</p>

			<ul>
				<li class="content_text"><strong>Enable E-TAF: Merge NTD peak data with matching Target Analyte peaks</strong>
				<p>Combines the nearest normal Non Targeted (NTD) peak with a Target Analyte Find peak. This 
				option is available within the TAF tab of a Data Processing method. Peak requirements are as 
				follows:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The NTD peak must be within a quarter peak width of the TAF apex to be matched.</li>
					<li>All required masses of the TAF peak must be contained in the NTD peak.</li>
					<li>TAF Peak True spectrum will be updated with the additional massed from the NTD peak</li>
					<li>NTD peak will be removed and TAF peak will become E-TAF</li>

				</li>
				
				<li class="content_text"><strong>Smooth windows size (points)</strong>
				<p>Select the desired number of points to use for smoothing from the Smooth window size dropdown.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li class="content_text"><strong>Peak FWHH (seconds)</strong>
				<p>Defines the expected full width at half height for the peaks within a given sample.  For a peak to 
				be found its FWHH must be within half to four times the provided value.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li class="content_text"><strong>Analyte</strong>
				<p>The name a given analyte is assigned that satisfies all the user defined Target Analyte Finding parameters.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li class="content_text"><strong>Formula</strong>
				<p>The formula for a given ion or isotope a given analyte must have to be found. Note, if multiple formulas 
				are entered both the Formula & Most Abundant fields will be empty.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li class="content_text"><strong>Most Abundant</strong>
				<p>Reports the most abundant isotope that is calculated from the formula provided.  This mass will be used

				</li>
				
				<li class="content_text"><strong>Minimum Peak Height/Area</strong>
				<p>The peak height/area that defines the threshold to discriminate between false positives and real peaks.  
				Values that are too low risk multiple false positives resulting in multiple peaks with the same analyte 
				name in the resulting peak table.  Conversely, values that are too high may prevent real peaks from being 
				found.  Some trial and error may be necessary may be necessary to determine the optimal values for a 
				given sample and analyte.</p>

				<li class="content_text"><strong>Signal Mode</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Centroid
					<p>A signal mode that uses centroid mass spectral data to generate the chromatographic trace
					used for Target Analyte Peak Finding. This may be appropriate for more abundant targets, 
					where target masses may contain mild to negligible spectral interference.</p>
					</li>
					
					<li>Profile
					<p>signal mode that uses profile mass spectral data to generate the chromatographic trace 
					used for Target Analyte Peak Finding. This may be appropriate for less abundant targets, 
					where spectral interference may prevent accurate centroiding of the target masses.</p>
					</li>
