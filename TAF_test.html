	<h1>Target Analyte Finding</h1>
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p class="content_text">Target Analyte Finding (TAF) is one of two data processing tools 
	that has the capability of finding analytes within a sample.  TAF is a data processing 
	technique which searches for a predefined set of analytes in a sample.  The other method 
	for finding peaks in a sample is Peak Finding which is used primarily for discovery work.  
	Each technique has a specific purpose, and associated <a target="_blank" href="PF_vs_TAF.html">
	advantages and disadvantages</a>.</p>
	
	<p class="content_text">Because TAF is a targeted method of finding peaks in a sample the 
	user must know the elution time and spectral properties of the targeted analytes.  The 
	following set of instructions describes the steps of creating and utilizing a TAF data 
	processing method for both 1D & GCxGC samples.</p>

			<ul>
				<li class="content_text"><strong>Manual Analyte Addition</strong>
					<p>To manually create the list of analytes to be targeted, begin by clicking the Add button 
					which will create a new analyte row.  Then, in the analyte column provide a name for the 
					analyte.  Next, define the retention time window the analyte is expected to be found in by 
					providing a Start and End time.  Then, define the Isotopes which will be used to find each 
					analyte within a given retention time window.  Click the advanced button which will prompt the 
					window to input Isotopes.  Within this window click the Add button, and provide the chemical 
					formula for the Isotopes you would like the software to target for a given analyte.  Upon 
					adding a chemical formula for a given fragment the software will automatically add the most 
					abundant isotopes and calculate their neutral masses.  Formula entry is case sensitive.</p>

				<li class="content_text"><strong>Adding Targeted Analytes from a Processed Sample</strong>
					<p>A more efficient method to add targeted analytes to a DP method is by automatically adding 
					analytes from a sample that has already been processed.  This is accomplished by selecting 
					the targeted analytes from the peak table, right clicking, and selecting Add Selected Peaks 
					to/TAF Method… When using this technique the retention time range will be created around the 
					absolute R.T. of the selected analyte based upon the user defined full width at half height 
					multiplier.  Targeted ions will be selected from the peak true, based upon the relative 
					abundance threshold defined by the user.</p>

				<li class="content_text"><strong>Adding Targeted Analytes from a Library</strong>
					<p>Another efficient way to add targeted analytes to a data processing method, is by 
					selecting them from a library.  The user can select analytes previously added to a 
					<a target="_blank" href="Libraries_UserCreated.html">User Created Library</a> or from 
					the <a target="_blank" href="Libraries_TargetSearch.html">TargetSearch</a> library.  
					Please note, this will not work using a commercially available library such as the NIST.  
					From the TAF tab within the DP method select the library button, define which library, 
					and then select the targeted analytes.  The retention time range and ions within the 
					library for the selected analyte will automatically added to the list of targeted analytes.</p>

		<li class="content_text"><strong>Reviewing Samples Processed with a TAF DP Method</strong>
			<p>When reviewing a sample processed using a TAF DP Method be sure the type column is visible and 
			the peak table view options is set to show not found peaks.  For a detailed description of how to 
			display these features see the <a target="_blank" href="DataReview.html">Data Review</a> section.  
			The type column provides information relative to the qualification of a given analyte.  There are 
			two analyte types represented in the samples processed in the videos above:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li class="content_text"><strong>Target</strong>: When a targeted analyte is found in a sample 
				the analyte’s type is set to Target.  For this to occur the required isotope or isotopes must 
				meet or exceed the area and height thresholds and are found within the defined retention time 
				range.  Therefore the unknown peak is assigned the corresponding analyte name specified in the 
				TAF data processing method, and the required isotopes are used to calculate the area and height.  
				The deconvoluted peak true consists of all of the listed isotopes (both required and not required) 
				that are found in the R.T. window and that share the same apex.  It is recommended to confirm 
				these results, as false positive values are quite common if the TAF parameters are not strict 
				enough.</li>
				
				<li class="content_text"><strong>Not Found: Target</strong>: An analyte’s type value is set to 
				Not Found: Target when it cannot be found in a sample using the instructions defined in the TAF 
				data processing method.  It is recommended to verify this fact by looking at the appropriate R.T. 
				range.  It is possible that the analyte is in the sample, but the conditions in the TAF data 
				processing method are too strict and the peak was discarded.  The following lists several of the 
				more common reasons TAF might fail to find a given peak.
				<ul>
					<li class="content_text">Setting less intense isotope(s) as required; often these ions are 
					not detected when the analyte is in trace concentrations.</li>
					<li class="content_text">The mass tolerance of a required ions is set too high. Often in 
					cases of low concentration the mass accuracy suffers.</li>
					<li class="content_text">The peak’s R.T. is not in the defined time window.</li>
					<li class="content_text">The area and height thresholds are too high.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
			</ul>
			
		</li>
		
		<li class="content_text"><strong>Handling Analytes that are Not Found</strong>
			<p>When a targeted analyte is not found by the TAF DP method it is recommend to visually verify this fact.  
			ChromaTOF makes this easy by double left clicking on the Not Found peak in the peak table.  This will cause 
			the chromatogram to zoom the expected R.T. as defined in the TAF DP method and switch to the defined ions 
			specified in the chromatogram selected peaks parameters.  If there is a peak near this location investigate 
			using the caliper spectrum to verify if it matches the expected spectral pattern, see the <a target="_blank" 
			href="DataReview.html">Data Review</a> section for more detail on this procedure.  If the visual inspection 
			proves the peak to be in the sample then systematically adjust the following peak finding criteria and reprocess 
			until ChromaTOF is able to detect the peak:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li class="content_text">Verify that all required ions are detected.</li>
				<li class="content_text">Ensure the peak is within the defined R.T. range.</li>
				<li class="content_text">Adjust the area or height thresholds.</li>
				<li class="content_text">Relax the mass threshold for the required ions.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>In the sample processed in the video above, Phosalone is not found.  By double clicking on the analyte in 
			the peak table and doing the visual inspection described above.  The peak is determined to be present, but not
			in the defined R.T. window.  The videos below show this inspection process as well as the correction being 
			implemented.</p>

		</li>
		
		<li class="content_text"><strong>Handling False Positive Analytes</strong>
			<p>When applying a TAF DP method it is not uncommon for the resulting peak table to have false positive 
			analytes.  This is typically the result of the peak finding criteria not being strict enough.  False 
			positives are easy to identify; they have suspiciously low S/N values (>10), and upon visual inspection 
			it is obvious that the peak in question is not real.  When a peak is double left clicked upon in either 
			the peak table or from the chromatogram ChromaTOF will zoom in on that peak and switch to the defined masses, 
			see the <a target="_blank" href="DataReview.html">Data Review</a> section.  After inspecting the chromatogram 
			it is usually obvious if the peak is real or false.  If the peak is false there are several corrective 
			actions that can be taken:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li class="content_text">Manually delete the peaks from the peak table.</li>
				<li class="content_text"><a target="_blank" href="PeakTableFiltration.html">Filter</a> the peak table
				based upon the peaks' properties.</li>
				<li class="content_text">Alter the peak finding threshold to prevent such false peaks as being identified as real.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>The video below demonstrates how to visually confirm if the peak is real or not.  A filter is utilized 
			to hide the false peaks from view, rather than making the peak finding thresholds tighter. This is done to prevent 
			the possibility of real peaks from being discarded; it is easier dealing with false positives than peaks not found.</p>

		</li>
		
		<li class="content_text"><strong>Multiple Quant Ions</strong>
			<p>Each ion defined as required in the list of input Masses for TAF will be used as a quantification ion 
			and thus be used to calculate basic peak metrics such as area and height.  An example of this is shown below, 
			Fenitrothion has two ions defined as Required C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>OPS (108.99) & C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub>PS 
			(124.98).  Both of these ions will be utilized as quant ions.  These integrations results can be displayed 
			individually and thus displayed as multiple lines in the peak or as a summation.  This behavior can be toggled via 
			the Peak Table View Options Show Sub-Quantitations check box.</p>
