	<h1>Quantitation Methods</h1>
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p class="content_text">Quantitation methods within ChromaTOF were uniquely designed to 
		meet the needs of today’s analytical laboratory.  Quantitation methods can be generated using 
		<a href="PeakFinding.html">Peak Finding</a> or <a href="TAF.html">Target 
			Analtye Finding</a> (TAF) Data Processing methods.  The purpose of this tutorial is to provide 
			a detailed stepwise process of generating a quantitation method as well as explaining some the 
			different software features within a Quantitation method.  The following procedure assumes 
			that the user has a basic working knowledge of <a href="DPOverview.html">data processing</a> and 
		<a href="DataReview.html">data review</a>.</p>
	<h3>Procedure</h3>
	<ol>
		<li class="content_text"><strong>Select the Primary Quantitation Standard</strong>
			<p>Begin by determining which standard to use as the Primary Quantitation Standard (PQS).  
				The mass spectrum and retention times (R.T.) obtained from this sample will be used 
				to qualify and identify analytes in subsequent standards used to generate the quantitation 
				curve and in unknown samples.  This is done through a comparison of the R.T. and peak 
				true of the selected analytes within the PQS, to the peaks found within a given 
				standard or unknown sample.  For standard samples, analytes that match those in the 
				PQS will be added as data points on the quantitation curve.  Alternatively, for 
				unknown samples which contain matching peaks, those will be quantitated on the 
				corresponding quantitation curve.  For this reason, careful consideration should be 
				taken in selecting a standard sample to use as the PQS.  Selecting standards at the 
				upper and lower extremes of the concentration range should be avoided.  Standards at 
				the high end might contain masses at the saturation point of the detector 
				which could skew mass ratios.  Standards with low or trace concentrations might be 
				approaching the minimum detectable concentration and therefore may be difficult to 
				obtain a clean mass spectrum. It is therefore recommend to use a standard near the 
				medium of your concentration range.

		<li class="content_text"><strong>Data Process the PQS</strong>
			<p>Create a basic Data Processing method using either a <a href="PeakFinding.html">Peak Finding</a> or 
			a <a href="TAF.html">TAF</a> Data Processing method to process the PQS.  In
			this narrative, we will be using a <a href="TAF.html">TAF</a> data processing method.  An
			example of this TAF DP method is shown below.

			</p>
		</li>
		
		<li class="content_text"><strong>Review the PQS</strong>
			<p>After processing the PQS, <a href="DataReview.html">Evaluate</a> the results and verify that all the analytes to be 
			included in the quantitation method are acceptable.  Acceptance criteria include the 
			following: appropriate retention time, spectral quality, and correct name assignment.  
			It is imperative, as explained before, that the mass spectra for the analytes obtained 
			from this sample are of the highest possible quality.  Within the peak table of the PQS 
			be sure the <a href="PeakFiltering_Group.html">group column</a> is visible.  
			For each analyte to be quantitated add a label in the group column.  This will streamline 
			searching, sorting, and filtering the analytes of interest in future steps.

			</p>
		</li>
		
		<li class="content_text"><strong>Create a New Quantitation Method</strong>
			<p>Select the Quantitation section of the Navigation Pane. In the List View 
			(the white space directly above the Navigation Pane) right-click and choose New.  
			The method can be renamed via the right click menu.
			</p>
		</li>
		
		<li class="content_text"><strong>Import the PQS</strong>
			<p>Add the processed and reviewed PQS to the Quantitation Table. 
			Right click inside the Quantitation Table and select “Add Standard”. A window will pop up allowing 
			you to browse through Acquired Samples, find and select the PQS. All analytes within the 
			selected sample will appear in the Quantitation Table.

			</p>
		</li>
		
		<li class="content_text"><strong>Remove Superfluous Analytes from the Quantitation Table</strong>
			<p>Only the peaks necessary to generate quantitation curves should be in the Quantitation 
			Table, any superfluous analytes should be removed.  
			Sorting the table using the group column makes this step easier.  Highlight all analytes 
			that were not grouped, right click within the Quantitation table and select 
			Delete Selected Analytes.
			<video class="content_media" src="DataProcessing_Media/QuantitationMethods_Media/DeleteSelectedAnalytes_QuantTbl_CT5.02.00.mp4" controls></video>
			</p>
		</li>
		
		<li class="content_text"><strong>Set Internal Standard(s) (optional)</strong>
			<p>If your application utilizes a/an internal standard(s), then define which 
			analytes are internal standards and which analyte(s) correspond to each internal standard.
			<video class="content_media" src="DataProcessing_Media/QuantitationMethods_Media/SetIntStd_QuantTbl_CT5.02.00.mp4" controls></video>
			</p>
		</li>
		
		<li class="content_text"><strong>Enter the PQS Analyte Theoretical Concentrations</strong>
			<p>For each of the analytes and internal standards in the PQS enter the theoretical concentration.  
			The column where concentrations should be entered is in the far right of the Quantitation table, 
			and the header matches the name of the sample. Note, you can copy (Ctrl + c) and paste (Ctrl + v)
			from a spread sheet application to increase the efficiency of this step.
			<video class="content_media" src="DataProcessing_Media/QuantitationMethods_Media/EnterPQSConc_QuantTbl_CT5.02.00.mp4" controls></video>
			</p>
		</li>
		
		<li class="content_text"><strong>Define the Required Quantitation Table Parameters</strong>
			<p>Define each of the necessary <a href="QuantAndRefTableParameters.html">Quantitation Table parameters</a>
			for your application. Below is an example of a Quantitation table with populated parameters.
			<img class="content_media" src="DataProcessing_Media/QuantitationMethods_Media/Quantitation_Table_GreenText_CT5.02.00.png"/>
			The retention time window, S/N threshold, and match threshold are the three peak qualifiers used during 
			the peak finding portion of data processing.  The Quantitation table above provides an example of a populated
			Quantitation table with peak qualifying parameters. The analyte names & group labels defined in the Quantitation method table above 
			will be assigned to any peaks from an unknown sample which meet all the qualification criteria. Additionally,
			the ion(s) entered in the masses column, define the quant mass(es) and mass tolerance for a given analyte.
			</p>
		</li>
		
		<li class="content_text"><strong>Peak Qualification & Quantitation Example</strong>
			<p>The paragraphs below narrate a scenario on peak finding, name & group assignment, area/height determination, and 
				concentration calculation utilizing a quantitation curve. Using the parameters shown in the Quantitation table above, a description of the qualification 
				and quantitation of peak #4, Acenaphthene will be outlined. Going forward, the Acenaphthene peak from the PQS 
				will be referred to as Acenaphthene<span class="sub-script">PQS</span>. The R.T. window has a range from 883.353 
				seconds to 885.353 seconds. If ChromaTOF locates a peak in this window within an unknown sample that satisfies the S/N threshold 
				of 15, it will spectrally compare the unknown peak to the peak true spectrum of Acenaphthene<span class="sub-script">PQS</span>.
			</p>
			
			<p>If a peak in an unknown sample satisfies the R.T., S/N Threshold, and Match Threshold criteria, ChromaTOF will assign this peak the same 
				name & group label as the the corresponding analyte in the PQS, in this example the name is Acenaphthene and the group label is PAH. 
				The Acenaphthene in the unknown sample will be referred
				to as Acenaphthene<span class="sub-script">Unk</span>. The software will then determine the area of Acenaphthene<span class="sub-script">Unk</span>
				using the same quant mass as was utilized to integrate Acenaphthene<span class="sub-script">PQS</span>. This mass is defined in the Masses
				column of the Quantitation table, for this example the mass is 153.07 ± 0.3 Da. Next, the concentration of 
				Acenaphthene<span class="sub-script">Unk</span> is calculated using the corresponding quantitation curve.
			</p>
			
			<p>If an internal standard is not used, then the quantitation curve is generated by plotting the the area of a given standard (y-axis) 
			versus theoretical concentration (x-axis).  An example of such a curve is shown directly below.
			<img class="content_media" src="DataProcessing_Media/QuantitationMethods_Media/QuantitationCurve_NoIS_CT5.02.00.png"/>
			For this scenario chemically labeled PAHs were used as internal standards.  When an internal
			standard is utilized, the quantitation curve is the result of plotting the ratio (y-axis) versus the 
			theoretical concentration (x-axis).  The ratio is equal to the area of the standard divided by the area of the 
			corresponding internal standard from the same sample.  See below for an example. The accuracy of the 
			resutling quantitation curve, and subsequent calculated concentrations, are vastly improved when using an internal standard.

		</li>
		
		<li class="content_text"><strong>Calculate Standards for PQS</strong>
			<p>After the Quantitation Table parameters have been defined, highlight all the samples
			in the Quantitation table then, select Calculate Standards from the right click menu.  
			This command applies the parameters to PQS.  Any additional standards to be imported into the 
			Quantitation Table will be processed based upon matching analytes in the PQS
			as defined by the required Quantitation table parameters.  During this operation 
			the text in the Standard table will change from <span class="green_txt">green</span>
			(calculation required) to <span class="red_txt">red</span> (calculating) to black (finished).
			The processing time will be similar to the duration the PQS initailly took to process.  In
			the video below the full processing time has been edited out for training purposes.
			<video class="content_media" src="DataProcessing_Media/QuantitationMethods_Media/CalculateStandards_PQS_CT5.02.00.mp4" controls></video>
			</p>
		</li>
		
		<li class="content_text"><strong>Import Additional Standard Samples</strong>
			<p>Import all additional standards into the quantitation method.  Right click 
			within the Quantitation Table and select Add Standard.  Browse through Acquired 
			Samples to find the remaining samples to be added to the quantitation method.  
			Multiple samples can be added at the same time by selecting the standards and 
			simultaneously holding the Shift key.  After doing so you'll notice new headers in the 
			Quantitation and Standard tables corresponding to each sample added.  Be careful 
			not to inadvertently add the PQS a second time.
			<video class="content_media" src="DataProcessing_Media/QuantitationMethods_Media/AllAdditionalStds_CT5.02.00.mp4" controls></video>
			</p>
		</li>
		
		<li class="content_text"><strong>Enter Theoretical Concentrations for Each Standard</strong>
			<p>Next, enter the theoretical concentrations of each analyte in each standard.  There are
			several methods which can be used to do so.  The first is not recommended, and that is
			to individually type each conentration value.  Not only is this very time consuming, but 
			it leads to transcription errors.  The next method is via copy (Ctrl + c) and pasting
			(Ctrl + v).  You can copy and paste from a spreadsheet application, or from 
			within ChromaTOF.  The last method is to use the fill method which has the capability of 
			applying a multiplier relative to the theoretical concentration of the corresponding analyte in the PQS.  The fill method
			will not apply to internal standards, because it is assumed that the internal standards 
			are spiked into each sample at the same concentration.
			</p>
			
			<p/>In our PAH Quantitation Example we are building 4 seperate quantitation curves.  Each PAH curve 
			is composed of 13 standard samples acquired in triplicate.  The standards range 4 orders 
			of magnitude from 0.2 pg – 2000 pg.  In each sample, chemically labeled PAHs were spiked at 
			50 pg.  Manually, typing all of these concentrations would require entering 312 separate 
			values which is not a feasible task.  To expedite this procedure the Quantitation table is 
			first sorted by the Type column to list the analytes and internal standards seperately.  The 
			50 pg internal standard concentration values are propagated by copy and pasting across all 
			156 entries.  The PAH concentrations are entered using the fill command with the multiplier 
			optional feature.  The video below demonstrates this procedure.
			<video class="content_media" src="DataProcessing_Media/QuantitationMethods_Media/EnterAllConc_QuantTbl_CT5.02.00.mp4" controls></video>
			</p>
		</li>
		
		<li class="content_text"><strong>Define Optional Quantitation Table Parameters</strong>
			<p>There are several optional functions available within a Quantitation method which will
			not be discussed here.  Some of them include: applying <a href="Quantitation_IonRatios.html">ion ratios</a>
			as additional peak qualifiers, imposing a <a href="Quantitation_ValidConcRange.html">valid concentration range</a>,
			and utilizing a <a href="Quant-Ref_RIProbe.html">retention index probe</a>.
			If you intend to utilize any of these optional tools enter the appropriate parameter values.
			</p>
		</li>
		
		<li class="content_text"><strong>Finalize the Quantitation Method</strong>
			<p>After all of the Quantitation method parameters have been defined, and the theoretical 
			concentrations entered the Quantitation method must be finalized before it can be used. 
			To accomplish this, select all rows in the Quantitation table, then 
			right click, and select Calculate Standards. 
			Prior to executing this command, the theoretical concentrations in the Quantitation table 
			and the  text in the standard table will initially be <span class="green_txt">green</span>. 
			While the standards are being calculated, this text will be shift to  
			<span class="red_txt">red</span> indicating that the operation is in progress. 
			Once it has completed, the text will become black. This will require
			a similar amount of time as the PQS initailly took to data process,
			times then number of standard samples added to the Quantitation method.  The 
			<a href="DataProcessing_MonitorQueue.html">data processing progress</a> 
			can be monitored using both the Data Processing Monitor and Data Processing Queue
			windows.
			</p>
			
			<p>During this process ChromaTOF is applying the data processing method initially used to 
			process the PQS to find all the peaks.  Next, it is identifying and integrating those peaks
			based upon the parameters set in the Quantitation table.  Finally, ChromaTOF is adding the 
			appropriate data to generate each quantitation curve. This is carried out for each 
			standard sample.

		</li>
		
		<li class="content_text"><strong>Reviewing a Finalized Quantitation Method</strong>
			<p>After calculating the standards, the quantitation curves will be generated and 
			the Quantitation method will be reviewable.  By clicking on a given analyte in the Quantitation table, the corresponding
			data for each standard will be populated in the Standard table as well as the resulting 
			Quantitation curve.  If an individual standard is selected from within
			the Standard table that peak will be displayed in the chromatogram, the red cursor will
			point to the corresponding point on the Quantitation curve, and its peak true
			will be shown in the spectral window.  The integration markers can be 
			<a href="Quant_ManuallyAdjustIntegrationMarkers.html">manually	changed</a>
			to adjust calculated areas of standards.
			<video class="content_media" src="DataProcessing_Media/QuantitationMethods_Media/Review_Quant_CT5.02.00.mp4" controls></video>
			</p>
		</li>
		
		<li class="content_text"><strong>Editing Finalized Quantitation Tables Parameters</strong>
			<p>If one of the required Quantitation method parameters is edited after calculating the standards, the text corresponding to that analyte will revert 
			back to <span class="green_txt">green</span>. Therefore, that analyte will require recalculation. You can save processing time by using "Calculate Analytes(s)" which will
			only recalculate the selected analyte(s) rather then the entire standard when Calculate Standards is used. To highlight specific analyte rows,
			right click on the corresponding row number while holding the Control key on your keyboard.

			</p>
		</li>
		
		<li class="content_text"><strong>Removing Standard Samples</strong>
			<p>Entire standard samples can be removed from the Quantitation method via the Quantitation table right click menu.
			This will remove all data from the selected sample from the Quantitation method including all analytes and internal
			internal standards.
			<video class="content_media" src="DataProcessing_Media/QuantitationMethods_Media/Quant_RemoveStdSample_CT5.02.00.mp4" controls></video>
			</p>
		</li>
		
		<li class="content_text"><strong>Removing Individual Standard Analytes</strong>
			<p>Alternatively, individual standard analytes can be removed from the Quantitation method via the Standard table right click menu.  
			This will only remove the specifically selected analyte or internal standard from the Quantitation method.
			<video class="content_media" src="DataProcessing_Media/QuantitationMethods_Media/Quant_RemoveIndividualStdAnalyte_CT5.02.00.mp4" controls></video>
			</p>
		</li>
		
		<li class="content_text"><strong>Applying a Quantitation Method</strong>
			<p>Now, that the Quantitation method has been successfully created, the next step involves incorporating 
			this method into a data processing method.  Begin by creating and renaming a new data processing method.  
			Next, from the list of data processing tasks, select the Quantitate Reference tab.  Then, add the desired quantitation method(s).  
			You will notice that the data processing method origianally used to process the PQS has been populated into this method.  In this
			example the Target Analyte Finding parameters.  To quantitate an unknown sample, process using this
			Data Procesing method.

			</p>
		</li>
		
		<li class="content_text"><strong>Reviewing Quantitated Data Samples</strong>
			<p>In order to effectively review the results, the Analyte Type, Concentration, Match, and Type columns should be displayed in 
			the peak table.
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				
				<li class="sub-list_test"><strong><em>Analyte Type</em></strong> - Reports the type value defined in the Quantitation table, the two 
					most common examples include Analyte and Internal Standard.
				</li>
			
				<li class="sub-list_test"><strong><em>Concentration</em></strong> - Displays the concentration calculated using the quantitation curve in the 
					Quantitation method.
				</li>
				
				<li class="sub-list_test"><strong><em>Match</em></strong> - Quantifies the spectral similarity between
					the standard analyte in the PQS and the matching peak in the unknown sample.  This is similar to a similarity
					score, where a perfect score is 1000.
				</li>
				
				<li class="sub-list_test"><strong><em>Type</em></strong> - Provides the user with information relevant to each analyte.  The following list provides 
					some of the quantitation related type fields and their definition.
					<ul>
					
						<li class="sub-list_test"><strong><em>Quantitated</em></strong> - The peak has been qualified based upon the user specified 
							Quantitation table parameters and therefore has been quantitated using the corresponding quantitation curve.
						</li>
						
						<li class="sub-list_test"><strong><em>Not Found</em></strong> - The peak exists in the Quantitation method, but was not 
							found in the unknown sample, based upon the user defined quantitation parameters.  It is possible that the analyte 
							in question is in the unknown sample, but the peak qualification parameters in the Quantitation method are too strict.
							ChromaTOF will place a place holder for these analytes in the peak table.
						</li>
						
					</ul>
					
				</li>
				
			</ul>
			
			<p>Depending on the Filter settings for your Peak Table you may see two entries for each of your analytes.  One entry for the 
			peak found via target analyte search and a duplicate entry for the peak once the quantitation method is applied.  If you 
			choose you can filter by type using the <a href="PeakTableFiltration.html">Peak Table filters</a>.  Below are the 
			data processing results from an unknown sample that was processed using the Apply Quantitation DP method created in the video above.  In
			the peak table below peaks of the type Target have been filtered out of view.
			<img class="content_media" src="DataProcessing_Media/QuantitationMethods_Media/Quant_ProcessedPAHUnknown_CT5.02.00.png"/>
			</p>
			
			<p>Notice that three of the four PAHs (Naphthalene, Acenaphthene, and Chrysene) from the Quantitation method were found in the unknown sample.  
			Therefore, each of these analytes were quantitated, assigned the corresponding name & group label from the Quantitation method, defined as Type = Quantitated, and the 
			calculated Match score is listed.  Alternatively, Phenanthrene could not be found in the sample and therefore it was given a placeholder in the peak table with 
			the name value set to Phenanthrene/PAH Quant Example (Analyte Name / Quantitation method).  Furthermore, the peak table shows the expected R.T. (this values comes from 
			the Absolute R.T. of the corresponding standard analyte within the PQS) and sets Type = Not Found.  Obviously, the Concentration, Area, and Height columns are empty.  
			The Match value that is reported in the peak table is the Match Threshold value defined in the Quantitation method.
			Lastly, the internal standards were also found, and their concentrations are listed.  However, since no Quantitation curve was generated for these peaks, ChromaTOF
			reports the theoretical concentration value defined in the Quantitation method.
