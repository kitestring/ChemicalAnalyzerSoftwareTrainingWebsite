	<h1>Peak Finding</h1>
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p class="content_text">Peak Finding (PF) is one of two data processing tools that has the 
	capability of finding analytes within a sample.  PF is a tool used primarily for discovery 
	work.  It is a qualitative technique to automatically find, create deconvoluted mass spectra, 
	and integrate all the compounds in a sample that satisfy the user’s peak filtering criteria.  
	The other method for finding peaks in a sample is Target Analyte Finding which is a data 
	processing method that searches for a predefined set of analytes in a sample.  Each technique 
	has a specific purpose, and associated <a href="PF_vs_TAF.html">
	pros and cons</a>.</p>
	
	<h3>Procedure</h3>
	<ol>
		<li class="content_text"><strong>Create New PF DP Method</strong>
			<p>In the videos below a PF DP method is created which utilizes a filter which 
			discards all peaks outside a retention time range of 825 – 1625 seconds.  This 
			is defined because analytes outside this range are not analytically significant 
			in this analysis.  All analytes that are found will be deconvoluted and 
			their base mass &#xB1 500 ppm will be used for the computation of area, height, 
			and other peak metrics.  In the GCxGC video, the spectral match required to combine 
			subpeaks is set to 500.</p>

		<ul>
			<li class="content_text"><strong>Peak Filtering Table</strong>: The Peak Filtering Table in the Peak Finding 
			page of the Data Processing method permits users to filter chromatographic peaks reported in the Peak Table. 
			The filters can limit reporting and library searching of unidentifiable spectra. Spectra may be rendered 
			unidentifiable by contamination with unrelated signals or by low signal-to-noise, or spectra may contain 
			insufficient number of signals to identify with confidence.  Different Peak Filtering parameters can be used 
			for different retention time segments. Retention time segments can be added to the table using the Add button, 
			and deleted using the Remove button.
			
			<ul>
				<li class="content_text"><strong>Start Time</strong>: The Start Time is the start of the retention time 
				segment. The end of the segment is the start of the next segment, or the end of the acquisition.</li>
				<li class="content_text"><strong>Report Peaks</strong>: Report Peaks turns peak reporting On or Off 
				for the retention time segment.</li>
				<li class="content_text"><strong>Minimum S/N</strong>: To be retained in the Peak Table, a deconvolved 
				spectrum must contain at least one signal that meets the specified Minimum Signal-to-Noise threshold. 
				The Minimum Signal-to-Noise threshold filters only at the level of the Peak Table; it does not affect 
				which signals are reported within a deconvolved spectrum.</li>
				<li class="content_text"><strong>Minimum Stick Count</strong>: To be retained in the Peak Table, a 
				deconvolved spectrum must contain at least as many signals (or “sticks”, from the visual appearance 
				of centroided spectra) as the Minimum Stick Count threshold. The Minimum Stick Count threshold filters 
				only at the level of the Peak Table; it does not affect which signals are reported within a deconvolved 
				spectrum.
				<p>Spectra that contain only a few sticks are rarely sufficient for confident analyte identification. The 
				Minimum Stick Count threshold can be used to reject such spectra before library search is performed, thus 
				reducing data processing time and reducing unidentifiable entries in the peak table. Because the Pegasus BT 
				records full profile spectra, and because the centroiding algorithm is designed for high sensitivity, the 
				stick count may exceed the molecular weight of the analyte. Some sticks may correspond to multiply charged 
				signals in the spectrum, and some may correspond to low-level noise. Setting the Minimum Stick Count threshold 
				higher than a few tens of sticks is not expected to have practical value in most applications.</p></li>

			<li class="content_text"><strong>GCxGC</strong>: Toggles the data processing method to handle 1D or  GCxGC samples.</li>
			
			<li class="content_text"><strong>Quantitation signal</strong>: Will be used to set the Peak Table's area, height 
			and tailing factor.</li>
			
			<li class="content_text"><strong>Quantitation mass tolerance</strong>: The quantitation mass tolerance which can be 
			set in units of Da or ppm.</li>

		<i class="caption_text">GCxGC Subpeak Combining Parameters</i>
		
		
		<ul>
			<li class="content_text"><strong>GCxGC Subpeak Combining</strong>: If GCxGC has been selected on the Peak Finding 
			page, a GCxGC Subpeak Combining page will be added to the DP method. This page has a section to specify prominent, 
			common fragments resulting from the use of a derivatizing reagent and a box to specify a mass spectral threshold 
			requirement for combining subpeaks of the same analyte.</li>
				<ul>
				<li class="content_text"><strong>Spectral Match Required to combine</strong>: A match score quantifies how similar 
				the deconvoluted mass spectrum of subpeak to another.  The more similar the two spectra are the higher their match 
				value, the range of possible is between 0 and 999.  This parameter sets the threshold of how spectrally similar 
				two subpeaks have to be to be combined.  When subpeaks are combined there are assigned to the same analyte and 
				their areas are summed when determining the total area of that analyte.</li>
				
				<li class="content_text"><strong>Derivatized Fragments Table</strong>: A derivative or derivative product is 
				the reaction product of an analyte and a derivatizing reagent. In gas chromatography, derivatization is used 
				to convert low volatility analytes to more volatile products, which are more amenable to analysis by gas 
				chromatography. The electron ionization mass spectra of these derivatives generally have common intense mass 
				fragments that are characteristic of the derivatizing reagent used. This similarity in derivative spectra 
				complicates the combining of modulated peaks (slices). The following description explains conceptually how the 
				addition of the common masses of the derivative products to the data processing method improve the results.
				
				<p>For GCxGC samples, after deconvolution, all modulations (slices) of a particular analyte are found and 
				grouped together based on their retention times and spectra. The NIST spectral comparison function is used 
				to compare the spectra of the modulated peaks. In the NIST algorithm, the more intense masses will affect the 
				match result more than the less intense masses. Because the common masses of the derivatives are shared among 
				all the derivatized products and they are usually the most intense masses, they will cause two different 
				derivatized products to have a very good spectral match and be grouped into one peak when they should not be 
				grouped together. For this reason, another spectral comparison is performed with the common masses of the 
				derivatives excluded. Both match values of these comparisons must pass a threshold in order to provide 
				confidence that the two slices are really from the same compound.</p></li>

		<li class="content_text"><strong>Processing a Sample using Peak Finding</strong>
			<p>If sample is processed using Peak Finding exclusively, all peaks found in the sample that satisfy the 
			filtering criteria will be listed in the peak table with their areas, heights, and other peak metrics.  In 
			the case of GCxGC samples the subpeaks will be combined.  However, since a means for peak identification has 
			not been included in the data processing method, the peaks found are given a generic peak name. </p>
			
			<p>It is often useful to utilize the <a href="DataProcessing_MonitorQueue.html">data processing 
			monitor & queue</a> when processing using peak finding due to the processing times.</p>
