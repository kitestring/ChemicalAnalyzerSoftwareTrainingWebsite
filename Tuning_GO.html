	<h1>Gain Optimization</h1>
	
	<p class="content_text">Adjusts the detector voltage to optimize its response to a predefined 
	area per ion. The area per ion value is not a user editable parameter, however it can be monitored 
	in the log when a Gain Optimization (GO) is being acquired.  A GO needs to be re-run from time to 
	time as the detector ages.  You can configure the automatic triggers for a GO in the 
	<a href="QCMethodsOverview.html">QC Method</a>.  A detector needs to be replaced once it is being 
	tuned to 3000 volts.  After the detector is replaced, the software will automatically run a GO 
	before the next sample is collected.</p>
	
	<p class="content_text">A GO can be added to the Acquisition Queue either as part of an <a href="Tuning_AutoTune.html">Auto-Tune</a> 
	or individually as a single line.  There are two videos below, the first demonstrates how to add a 
	GO to the Acquisition Queue individually, and the second shows what a GO looks like as it is being 
	collected.</p>
