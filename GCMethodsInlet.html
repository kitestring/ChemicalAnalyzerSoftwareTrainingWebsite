	<h3>Inlet Configuration</h3>
	
	<ol>
		<li class="content_text">Select the Front Inlet Type and/or Back Inlet type depending on the capillary 
		configuration by selecting the drop-down arrow and making a selection from the list.
		<p>Inlet Types:</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="content_text">Select Split/Splitless, PTV, or On-Column depending on requirements. Refer 
			to the Agilent User Information CD for further information about these inlets.</li>
			<li class="content_text">Select Gerstel when the Gerstel CIS4 inlet is installed. When this inlet is 
			selected, the inlet temperature parameters are not downloaded to the GC. The Gerstel external controller 
			controls the inlet temperature.</li>
			<li class="content_text">Select None when a non-supported inlet or no inlet is installed.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		
		<li class="content_text">Select the Front Inlet Mode and/or Back Inlet Mode depending on the capillary 
		configuration by choosing a selection from the list. Inlet Mode is not active if either On-Column or None 
		is selected for Inlet Type.
		<p>Inlet Types:</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="content_text">Select Splitless for trace concentrations. Splitless operates with the split 
			vent closed.</li>
			<li class="content_text">Select Split when only part of the sample goes onto the column. Split operates 
			with the split vent open.</li>
			<li class="content_text">Select Pulsed Splitless to increase pressure in the inlet during a splitless 
			injection.</li>
			<li class="content_text">Select Pulsed Split to increase pressure in the inlet during a split injection.</li>
			<li class="content_text">Select Solvent Vent for a splitless injection with the split vent open to flush 
			solvent from the inlet. Solvent Vent is available with a PTV inlet.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		
		<li class="content_text">If both columns are defined, select the Active Inlet Location. If only one column is 
		defined, the software automatically selects it, and this option is not displayed.</li>
		<ul style="list-style-type:none">
			<li class="content_text">If both columns are defined, there will be separate Front and Back tabs for the Inlet 
			page, where information for the respective inlet can be entered. Temperature affects all plumbed inlets and 
			requires flow in order to avoid damage. If both inlets are plumbed, remember to configure the inactive inlet as 
			well as the active inlet.</li>

	<h3>Flow Mode</h3>
	<p class="content_text">If the following parameter values are not entered correctly, then the column and split flows 
	calculated will be inaccurate.  When the pressure/flow configuration is valid, a green icon appears with a message that 
	displays “No problems detected with the pressure/flow.” When the pressure/flow configuration is not valid, a red icon 
	appears with an error message that displays the cause of the problem.</p>
	
	<h3>Corrected Constant Flow Via Pressure Ramps Checkbox</h3>
	<p class="content_text">Select Corrected Constant Flow when using one very short column or when using a multi-capillary 
	configuration. When the checkbox is selected, enter the desired column flow. The software automatically adjusts all 
	settings. Verify the column configuration is entered correctly.  Clear the checkbox to select one of the column modes, 
	which are explained as follows.</p>
	
	<h3>Column Modes</h3>
	
	<ul>
		<li class="content_text">Select <strong>Constant Pressure</strong> and then complete the front inlet and/or back 
		inlet pressure table, depending on whether or not column flow path 2 is selected. In the table, enter the pressure 
		for the chromatographic run to maintain the column pressure at the head of the column throughout the run. As the 
		gas viscosity changes, mass flow rate changes, but the gauge pressure does not change.</li>
		<li class="content_text">Select <strong>Constant Flow</strong> and then complete the front inlet flow and/or back 
		inlet flow, depending on whether or not column flow path 2 is selected. In the table, enter the flow rate for the 
		carrier gas through the column to maintain a constant flow rate of the carrier gas in the column throughout the 
		run. As the gas viscosity changes due to a temperature program, the column head pressure is adjusted to keep the 
		flow constant. The flow will only be accurate for a single column >5m and one temperature zone. With the Constant 
		Flow mode, the gas flow through the column is supposed to be constant, but the GC may not correctly calculate a 
		constant flow due to a number of enhanced column configurations supported by ChromaTOF®. Corrected constant flow 
		takes these configurations into account.</li>
		<li class="content_text">Select <strong>Ramped Flow</strong> to vary the flow rate in the column during the run 
		according to the defined flow program. Complete the Flow Rate Program Table to set the parameters that control the 
		flow rate and timing of flow rate in column. For the Initial Flow, enter the beginning flow rate for the carrier 
		gas through the column; for Time at Initial Flow, enter the length of time flow rate stays at initial flow before 
		beginning the programmed flow rate changes.</li>
		<li class="content_text">Select <strong>Add</strong> to insert a ramping step to the table.</li>
		<li class="content_text">Select <strong>Remove</strong> to delete a ramping step from the table.</li>
		<li class="content_text">Select <strong>Ramped Pressure</strong> to vary column head gauge pressure during the 
		run according to the defined program. Complete the Pressure Program Table to set the parameters that control the

	<h3>Constant Flow Correction</h3>
	
	<p class="content_text">The following section provides additional information about the flow modes when a column 
	configuration other than the standard GC column configuration is used.</p>
	
	<p class="content_text">The four flow modes of Constant Flow, Ramped Flow, Constant Pressure, and Ramped Pressure 
	are based on the flow control capabilities of the Agilent GC. The control of flow by the Agilent GC is based on the 
	dimensions (length and inner diameter) of a single capillary, GC oven temperature, and inlet and outlet pressures. 
	However, depending on the capillary dimensions and the effect of the transfer line on flow, the flow calculated by 
	the GC can have significant error. This error is in accuracy and not precision of flow control. Even with the accuracy 
	error, the flow control of the Agilent GC will still be very good.</p>
	
	<p class="content_text">For conventional GC, the error in flow is quite small and not significant, which means the 
	Agilent GC flow modes are appropriate in typical single-column situations. In order for the GC to control flow accurately 
	throughout the chromatographic run, all of the following must be true:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li class="content_text">In the capillary configuration, all capillaries are located in the GC oven.</li>
		<li class="content_text">The total length of the capillaries exceeds 5 meters.</li>
		<li class="content_text">The GCxGC option is not selected.</li>
		<li class="content_text">A flow combiner is not in use.</li>
		<li class="content_text">All capillaries are the same ID.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p class="content_text">In the case where any of the previous requirements are not met, the GC will only accurately set 
	the flow at the start of a run. In this case it is more appropriate to use Corrected Constant Flow Via Pressure Ramps.</p>
	
	<p class="content_text">The location of each capillary must be explicitly specified in the capillary configuration.</p>
	
	<h3>Single Column Configuration</h3>
	
	<ul style="list-style-type:none">
		<li><strong>Constant Flow Mode</strong></li>
		<li class="content_text">The Agilent GC flow modes are appropriate for single column configurations >5m (for example, 
		only a single column is specified in the capillary configuration table and no transfer line is specified). The ChromaTOF 
		software downloads column dimensions entered, and the GC calculates column flow and split flow based on the column 
		dimensions, oven temperature, and split ratio specified.</li>
		
		<li><strong>Corrected Constant Flow Via Pressure Ramps Mode</strong></li>
		<li class="content_text">This mode approximates constant flow by linear pressure ramps based on the capillary configuration 
		table. This mode is recommended in general whenever the multiple capillaries are of different ID and/or in different temperature 
		zones. An equivalent column length is downloaded to the GC so that the GC calculates accurate column and split flows at initial 
		conditions. The pressure program then approximates constant flow throughout the temperature program.</li>
		<li class="content_text">This mode is not necessary for single column configurations unless a very short column is used 
		(i.e., 5 meters or less). When a very short column is used, the short portion of column in the transfer line becomes a 
		significant part of the restriction at the high transfer line temperature when the oven temperature is low. Using the constant 
		column flow mode of the Agilent GC can result in an initial flow error of >10% when the oven is at 40 °C and the column is 2 m. 
		This error decreases to zero as the oven temperature goes to the temperature of the transfer line. This error also increases as 
		the column becomes shorter. This error is in flow accuracy and not precision. Even with the flow error, precision is very good 
		and will provide good retention time reproducibility.</li>
		<li class="content_text">There are conditions under which this mode may be disabled. These conditions include the following 
		though other situations are possible:</li>
		<ul>
			<li class="content_text">More than three pressure ramps are required. A maximum of three pressure ramps is possible. To 
			reduce the number of pressure ramps, reduce the number of temperature ramps and/or temperature holds of different lengths 
			for the multiple temperature zones.</li>
			<li class="content_text">An incorrect column configuration that will not allow the software to calculate pressures to 
			approximate a flow.</li>
			<li class="content_text">When a real, physically meaningful result cannot be calculated. Examples of situations where 
			real, physically meaningful results cannot be calculated would be cases involving the optional flow combiner where certain 
			flows or pressures cannot be achieved because of the other pressures or flows specified. A specific example, though other 
			examples exist, would be when a subambient pressure in one of the inlets would be required.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h3>Multi-Capillary Configurations</h3>
	
	<ul style="list-style-type:none">
		<li class="content_text">Configurations with multiple capillaries may use the GC flow modes if all capillaries located in 
		the GC oven are the same internal diameter. However, when more than one capillary is used in a column configuration, the 
		Corrected Constant Flow Mode is typically recommended.</li>
		<li class="content_text">The capillary configuration is specified in the <a href="System_ColumnSetup.html">
		Column Configuration Table</a> available from Instrument on the System ribbon bar.</li>
		<li class="content_text">If the GCxGC option is selected, the definition in the capillary configuration table must agree 
		with whether the secondary oven checkbox is selected or cleared in the GC Method</li>
		<li class="content_text">For all multi-capillary configurations, an equivalent column length is calculated for all flow 
		modes (this is different from a single column) so that the split flow is accurately calculated from an accurate column 
		flow and the entered split ratio. The user will see this equivalent length for the column dimensions displayed on the GC. 
		The equivalent length is based on all of the capillaries entered in the Column Configuration Table and their temperatures.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h3>Actual Flow in Different Modes</h3>
	
	<ul style="list-style-type:none">
		<li class="content_text">Constant Flow Mode Flow is accurate at the beginning because of the equivalent length column 
		downloaded. This is different from single column constant flow mode.  As the temperature increases, the actual flow 
		increases relative to the target flow. The magnitude of the error in flow will depend on the lengths, inner diameters (ID), 
		temperatures of the columns, and capillary transfer lines.</li>
		<li class="content_text">If the multiple capillaries are the same ID, total length > 5 m, and their temperatures are 
		the same, the error will be very small. If one of the columns is short with a smaller ID (typical GCxGC) and/or the 
		temperature zones are very different, the error will be large.</li>
		<li class="content_text">Ramped Flow Mode offers the same behavior as constant flow mode, but flow is programmed.</li>
		<li class="content_text">Flow with Constant Pressure Mode depends on overall restriction of combined columns and transfer 
		line. An equivalent column is calculated for the initial conditions. This allows the GC to calculate accurate column 
		and split flows at the initial conditions.</li>
		<li class="content_text">With Ramped Pressure Mode, an equivalent column is calculated for the initial conditions the 
		same as for the constant pressure mode so that the initial column and split flows are accurate.</li>
	</ul>
