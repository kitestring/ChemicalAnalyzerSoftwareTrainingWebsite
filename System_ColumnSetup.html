	<h1>Global Column Configuration</h1>
	
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p class="content_text">Column configuration is the specification of capillary dimensions, inlet and 
	outlet connections of the capillaries, and the temperature zones of the capillaries. This information 
	is required by the software to calculate certain control parameters of the GC, such as pressure programs 
	for corrected constant flow mode.  Specifying the column configuration also allows control of situations 
	such as where both a front and a back inlet are installed on the GC and a column from each inlet is 
	installed in the mass spectrometer the user can control both inlets through the Chromatograph method.  
	One inlet will be specified as active, and one inlet will be specified as inactive. A flow mode can be 
	selected and applied to both inlets, but different parameters can be specified for each inlet such as 
	different flows in the corrected constant flow mode. A low flow is recommended on the idle column to 
	minimize its impact on the mass spectrometer. The following section explains how to enter the column 
	configuration using the Column Configuration table.</p>
	
	<p class="content_text">To define the column configuration use the Column Configuration Table located on 
	the System ribbon bar.  This column configuration from the Column Configuration table on the Instrument 
	menu will be applied each time a new Chromatograph method is created. Previously created Chromatograph 
	methods will retain their configurations, but they must be updated to correspond with the column 
	configuration that has been defined in the Column Configuration table. The column configuration defined 
	in the Column Configuration Table is considered to be the system wide column configuration.  
	Chromatograph methods with column configurations that differ from the system wide column configuration 
	cannot be used. When this situation is the case, an error message will display in the Acquisition Queue. 
	The error message will disappear once the Chromatograph method is updated to the system column 
	configuration.</p>
