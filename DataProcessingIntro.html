	<h1>Data Processing Overview</h1>
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p class="content_text">ChromaTOF-BT provides its users a powerful set of tools 
	for both qualitative and quantitative data analysis.  This section provides a 
	basic description of each of the data processing tools, elaborates on the workflow 
	of a data processing job, illustrates the various ways to process a sample, 
	and demonstrates how to monitor the status of a data processing job.  Below is a 
	list of each of the data processing tasks available in the ChromaTOF-BT software 
	platform with a brief description of each.</p>
	
	<h3>Data Processing Tasks</h3>
	<ol>
		<li class="sub-list_test">Mass Calibration: Re-mass calibrates the sample 
		replacing the existing mass calibration constants.
		</li>
		
		<li class="sub-list_test"><a target="_blank" href="PeakFinding.html">Peak Finding</a>: 
		Finds all peaks in a sample that satisfy the user defined parameters.  This is used primarily for discovery analytics.
		</li>
		
		<li class="sub-list_test"><a target="_blank" href="TAF.html">Target Analtye Finding</a>: 
		Finds specific peaks in a sample defined by the user.  This mode of peak discovery is used for routine or targeted analysis.
		</li>
		
		<li class="sub-list_test">Classification: Provides a way to process data more efficiently by grouping compounds of similar chemical functionality.  This technique is only available with GCxGC samples.
		</li>
		
		<li class="sub-list_test">Retention Index: A means of calculating a Kovats Retention Index value based upon the retention times of a series of Retention Index marker analytes.  This is typically used to provide further confidence for the identification of a given analyte.
		</li>
		
		<li class="sub-list_test">Quantitate / Reference
		<ol>
			<li><a target="_blank" href="QuantitationMethods.html">Quantitations</a>: 
			A tool for determining the concentration of analytes utilizing a calibration 
			equation generated from a set of standard samples.
			</li>
			
			<li><a target="_blank" href="ReferenceMethods.html">References</a>: A method 
			for automating sample to sample comparisons.  In doing so, it ensure that 
			common analytes across multiple samples are assigned the same name, group label, 
			and integrated with identical quant mass(es).  Lastly, this tool can be used to 
			calculate relative concentrations as compared to a single reference analyte.
			</li>
			
			<li>Semi-Quantitations
			</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
		
		<li class="sub-list_test">Library Search Options
		<ol>
			<li><a target="_blank" href="LibrarySearchOptions_SpectralSimilarity.html">Spectral Similarity</a>: Identifies unknown analytes through spectral comparison of their deconvoluted mass spectrum and a given library mass specrum.
			</li>
			
			<li>Formula
			</li>
			
			<li>Reverse Target
			</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
		
		<li class="sub-list_test">Data Export Options: Sample files can be exported out of ChromaTOF and converted into a variety of formats.
		</li>
		
		<li class="sub-list_test">Peak Data ASCII Export Options: User specified Peak table, library hit, and spectral information can be exported into ASCII formatted text files which are compatible with most spread sheet applications.
		</li>
		
	</ol>
	
	<h3>Workflow</h3>
	<p class="content_text">Below is an example of a data processing method with Peak Finding, 
	Quantitate/Reference (an embedded Quantitation Method) and Library Searching tasks enabled.</p>
	
	<img id="content_media" src="DataProcessing_Media/Overview/ExampleDPMethod_ProcessFlow_CT5.31.16.png">
	
	<p class="content_text">When processing samples ChromaTOF will always execute data processing tasks 
	from the top down in the sequence listed in the Data Processing method tab on the left side of the 
	method.  In the example Data Processing method shown above first the Peak Finding task will find and 
	deconvolute all the peaks in the sample that meet the user defined criteria.  Next, the analytes that 
	satisfy the peak matching criteria in the embedded Quantitation Method will be assigned the ID, group 
	label, and integrated as defined in the Quant method; then quantitated using the corresponding 
	calibration equation.  Finally, any remaining analytes not handled by the Quantitation Method will 
	be identified during the Library Search task. </p>
	
	<p class="content_text">As the list above indicates, there are two modes of peak discovery either 
	Peak Finding or Target Analyte Finding.  Each is intended for a specific purpose and has 
	<a target="_blank" href="PF_vs_TAF.html">advantages as well as disadvantages</a>.</p>
	
	<h3>Sample Processing: Acquisition Queue</h3>
	<p class="content_text">The user can elect to include a data processing job to a given sample 
	immediately after acquisition.  This is done by including the desired data processing method within 
	the corresponding line of the <a target="_blank" href="AcquisitionQueueUtilization.html">Acquisition Queue</a>.</p>
	
	<a class="content_media"><video src="DataProcessing_Media/Overview/ProcessSingleSampleViaAcquisitionQueue_CT5.31.16.mp4" controls></a>
	
	<p class="content_text">To save time multiple sample acquisitions can be assigned to a single DP method 
	using a single operation.  This is done through the use of the Fill command.  Highlight and right click 
	all cells which will be processed with the same data processing method then select the
	desired data processing method.</p>
	
	<a class="content_media"><video src="DataProcessing_Media/Overview/ProcessMultiSamplesViaAcquisitionQueue_CT5.31.16.mp4" controls></a>
	
	<h3>Sample Processing: Acquired Samples</h3>
	<p class="content_text">Additionally, samples can be processed from Acquired Samples 
	view by right clicking on the sample to be processed then select “Process Data…”.  
	Next, select the sample or samples to be included in the data processing job.  To 
	select a range of samples hold the Shift Key while selecting the first and last 
	sample, alternatively hold the Ctrl Key to select multiple nonconsecutive samples.  
	Finally, select the Data Processing method.  While a sample is being processed it 
	will have a gear overlaid on its icon and it cannot be reviewed until processing is completed.</p>
	
	<a class="content_media"><video src="DataProcessing_Media/Overview/ProcessFromAcquiredSamples_CT5.31.16.mp4" controls></a>
	
	<h3>Monitoring Data Processing Jobs</h3>
	<p class="content_text">The status of a series of data processing jobs can be monitored and edited 
	by means of the <a target="_blank" href="DataProcessing_MonitorQueue.html">Data Processing Queue & Monitor</a> windows.  
	The Data Processing Queue and Monitor windows can be access by the top ribbon under the “Views” tab.</p>
	
	<h3>View a Samples Processing History</h3>
	<p class="content_text">If a sample is data processed multiple times, the earlier data processing iterations 
	are not lost or overwritten.  Each data processing iteration, and the corresponding data processing method 
	are saved and can be retrieved.  Even if the data processing method has been deleted or changed, its state 
	when the sample was processed is retained.  To retrieve a historical data processing iteration or method right 
	click on the desired sample file name and select “Select DP Result…”.  In the resulting prompt, the name of 
	each data processing method used to process the sample will be listed.  By selecting a given data processing 
	method from the list and clicking ok, the data processing results will revert back to the corresponding state 
	from that data processing iteration.  This includes all manual changes for example, analyte ID changes, defining 
	a group label, or altering the Quant mass.</p>

	<p class="content_text">To save a historical copy of a data processing method, right click within the desired 
	DP method and select “Save As”.  You will then be prompted to define the name and location of the selected 
	DP method.</p>
