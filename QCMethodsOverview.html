	<h1>Quality Control Methods</h1>
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p class="content_text">The Quality Control (QC) method controls the 
	setup for automatically scheduling instrument optimization, detector drift, 
	instrument checks, and sample runs.</p>
	
	<h3>Method Description</h3>
	<img id="content_media" src="MethodBuilding_Media/QC/Events_CT5.31.16.png">
	<ul class="content_text">
		<li class="content_text">The Events tab for the QC Method lists events and what actions they will 
		automatically trigger if the QC Method is specified in the Acquisition Queue.</li>
		
		<li class="content_text">For each section on the Event page, the user can select the desired course of 
		action by either selecting from the drop-down list or setting the checkbox(es) to 
		selected (will run) or cleared (will not run). Even though the settings can be 
		changed, using the default Events settings is highly recommended.</li>
		
		<li class="content_text">On the other pages of the method, the user can specify when the tune should be 
		scheduled (based on hours and/or the number samples run) and what Acquisition Queue 
		settings should be used when the tune actually runs.</li>
		
		<li class="content_text">For the Selected Parameters tabs, select the checkbox for hours and/or samples.
		<ul>
			<li class="content_text">Select hours to specify the maximum amount of time that has passed since the last 
			check was performed. If more than the specified time has elapsed, the check is automatically 
			scheduled prior to running the next sample.</li>
			
			<li class="content_text">Select samples to specify the maximum number of samples that have been collected since 
			the last check was performed. Once the maximum number of samples has been reached, the 
			check is automatically scheduled prior to running the next sample.</li>
			
			<li class="content_text">Complete the Acquire table by selecting the desired folder and name, and optionally 
			specify methods to use when the tune runs. These values will be used in the Acquisition 
			Queue.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		
		<li class="content_text">Leak Check has the following additional test parameters:
		<ul>
			<li class="content_text">Select the checkbox next to Open Tune Compound Valve to allow the tune compound to 
			enter the system during the leak check.</li>
			<li class="content_text">Fill out the Criteria table with the criteria that must be satisfied in order for 
			the leak check to pass. The leak check is for the vacuum chamber of the mass spectrometer.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		
		<li class="content_text">Both the carrier gas used and the state of the tune compound valve checkbox (On or Off) 
		should be taken into account when setting up criteria for the leak check.</li>
	</ul>
