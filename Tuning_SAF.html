	<p class="content_text">A Source and Analyzer Focus (SAF) adjusts the flight tube voltages 
	in order to optimize the intensity, resolution, and symmetry of the spectral peaks 
	produced by the instrument. This is an automatic tune; no user intervention is required. 
	The following screenshot is an example of what the user might see on the screen during 
	a SAF.  Note, this window can be minimized, but cannot be closed while 
	the system is activley acquiring a SAF.</p>

	<p class="content_text">In general, users can ignore the information that is displayed here—the 
	most useful information is how many stages are complete and how many are left. “Details” displays 
	advanced information about the status of the tune. “Track active stage” means the tab for each stage 
	will be automatically activated when its stage begins. “Export data” allows you to export the raw 
	data collected during the tune in CSV format</p>
	
	<p class="content_text">A SAF can be added to the Acquisition Queue either as part of an 
	<a href="Tuning_AutoTune.html">Auto-Tune</a> or individually as a single line.  There are two videos 
	below, the first demonstrates how to add a SAF to the Acquisition Queue individually, and the second 
	shows what a SAF looks like as it is being acquired.</p>
