	<p class="content_text">A Source and Analyzer Focus (SAF) adjusts the flight tube voltages 
	in order to optimize the intensity, resolution, and symmetry of the spectral peaks 
	produced by the instrument. This is an automatic tune; no user intervention is required. 
	The following screenshot is an example of what the user might see on the screen during 
	a SAF.  Note, this window can be minimized, but cannot be closed while 
	the system is activley acquiring an SAF.</p>

	<a href="Tuning_AutoTune.html">Auto-Tune</a> or individually as a single line.  There are two videos 
	below, the first demonstrates how to add a SAF to the Acquisition Queue individually, and the second
