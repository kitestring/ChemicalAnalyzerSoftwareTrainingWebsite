	<h3>GCxGC Timing Parameters</h1>
	
	<ol>
		<li class="content_text">In the GCxGC page, for the pre-cool and purge cold jet time, enter a time 
		of 0 to 10 seconds during which the cold jet valves are opened at the time of injection to cool the 
		cold jets. A time of zero seconds should be sufficient for long column dead times. For short column 
		dead times, volatile components may elute before the modulator can establish good cold flow, then a 
		time of 10 seconds should be sufficient to establish low cold jet temperatures.</li>
		<li class="content_text">Enter parameters for the Second Dimension Time (Modulation Period) and the 
		hot pulse time, explained as follows. The Second Dimension Time and the Hot Pulse Time can be varied 
		with the 709-802-355 CF Modulator Oven Assembly and with the 709-802-353 LN2 Modulator Oven Assembly. 
		These parameters can be varied throughout a run. A table is provided for these parameters. In each 
		line of the table enter the end time for the specified modulation period and hot pulse time. Refer 
		to the following example for an example table. The parameters for your specific application may not 
		be the same as those shown in the example.</li>
		<ol type="A">
			<li class="content_text">The factors relating to the Second Dimension Time are column length, 2nd 
			column stationary phase, and 2nd column temperature. Enter the Second Dimension Time in seconds 
			in the table.</li>
			<li class="content_text">Enter the length of time in seconds for the hot pulse.  It is recommended 
			to adjust the hot pulse time according to desired results.  The default hot pulse time is good for 
			general use; however, when modulation periods are long and compounds are of low volatility, 
			increasing the hot pulse time until the value for the cooltime between stages is between 0.4 and 1 
			sec is recommended. Keep in mind that high boiling point compounds require less cooling so the 
			cooltime between stages can be less as compared to high volatility compounds. For short 2nd 
			dimension periods, shorter hot pulse times are more appropriate; for longer 2nd dimension periods, 
			longer hot pulse times are more appropriate. For samples containing analytes covering a wide range 
			of volatility, the hot pulse must be long enough to reinject the least volatile compounds, but 
			short enough that the cooling is sufficient to trap the most volatile compounds. Another useful 
			rule for selecting a hot pulse time is that the hot pulse time should be 30% of the modulation 
			period (second dimension separation time). If the hot pulse time is too short, material may not 
			be completely volatilized in the modulator during the hot pulse and material will remain in the 
			modulator to be released in subsequent cycles, resulting in apparent peak tailing in the first 
			chromatographic dimension. The hot pulse time must be less than 50% of the modulation period in 
			order to have a positive cold pulse time. Shorter hot pulses may be used to improve trapping of 
			highly volatile compounds, while longer hot pulses may be appropriate for high boiling point 
			compounds that may tend to be retained in the modulator. Problems with retained compounds may 
			also be addressed by a higher modulator temperature if allowed by the column maximum temperature.</li>
			<li class="content_text">The Cooling Time Between Stages displays the length of time (in 
			seconds) the cryocooling will be on for one stage before the start of the hot pulse on the 
			other stage. This is the time one stage is cooled before the sample is released from the other 
			stage. Typically, a cool time of 0.5 sec is sufficient, but for short 2nd dimension periods, 
			it can be smaller. For very volatile components longer cooling times may be required. This is 
			a calculated field based on the value entered for the hot pulse time; therefore, you cannot 
			enter a value in this field. Avoid entering a value so high for the hot pulse time that a 
			negative number appears for the Cooling Time Between Stages.</li>
		</ol>
		<li class="content_text">Pre-cool and Purge Cold Jet is the time both cold jets are open before 
		modulation starts. This is generally not needed; however, for fast separations with early eluting 
		peaks, this time can cool the cold jets more quickly at the start.</li>

		<li class="content_text">For the consumable-free modulator option, select the Chiller Enabled 
		checkbox to allow for software control of the FTS Immersion Cooler.</li>
		<li class="content_text">For the consumable-free modulator option, for Chiller Temperature,
