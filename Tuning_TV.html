	<h1>Tune Validation</h1>
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p class="content_text">To ensure the quality of the acquired data perform a Tune Validation 
	(Daily Instrument Check) daily.  A tune validation is typically acquired as the last step of a 
	full system tune, and the data generated is used to generate a performance report.  Performance 
	reports are designed to provide qualitative information regarding the current state of the 
	instrument. Currently, there is one type of performance report, the Tune Validation Performance 
	Report.</p>
	
	<p class="content_text">Performance reports are based on the immediate data collection capabilities 
	of the data acquisition system. Post-collection data processing, such as mass calibration, should not 
	be performed on the raw samples collected as this will produce ambiguity between what the user sees 
	while viewing the performance report vs. viewing the sample directly. Information obtained during the 
	collection is set aside and stored separately, and as such, the collected sample can be freely removed 
	from the database afterwards.</p>
	
	<h3>Running a Tune Validation</h3>
	<p class="content_text">A Tune Validation can be run individually or as part of an 
	<a href="Tuning_AutoTune.html">Auto-Tune</a>.  The video below demonstrates how to set the Acquisition 
	Queue to run a tune validation by itself.  Additionally, it can be configured to run at prespecified 
	intervals using the <a href="QCMethodsOverview.html">Quality Control</a> Method.</p>

	<h3>Viewing a Performance Report</h3>
	<p class="content_text">Once a performance report has been created, access it with the Performance Report 
	Viewer. The viewer can be found via the Performance Reports button on the System tab of the ribbon bar.  
	The video below provides a depiction of this procedure.</p>

	<i class="caption_text">Viewing a Performance Report, the Performance report may differ depending on the 
	versions of ChromaTOF.</i>
	
	<h3>Understanding the Tune Validation Performance Report</h3>
	<p class="content_text">The Tune Validation Performance Report gives a quick snapshot of the instrument’s 
	current performance in regards to tune quality. A 90 second raw acquisition is initiated and spectral 
	analysis is performed upon the data. In the following sections, each area of the report will be explained 
	in more detail.  The results on the Tune Validation Report are scaled to 10 spectra per second collected 
	at 1 KHz to allow meaningful comparison of reports whose data was collected using different settings.</p>
	
	<p class="content_text">Tune Validation Performance reports are based on the expectation that PFTBA is 
	used as the tune compound within the system. As such, during data analysis, mass 69 is used as the 
	reference mass. The criteria assume the tune mass in the MS method is mass 219; should another tune 
	mass be used, the criteria may incorrectly report pass/fail because they are based on 219.</p>

		<ul style="list-style-type:none">
			<li class="content_text">The information section of the Tune Validation Performance Report 
			provides the basic information regarding when the report was generated and which methods were 
			used in the collection. Status information regarding the last time the instrument was tuned 
			with actions such as <a href="Tuning_LC.html">Leak Check</a>, <a href="Tuning_MC.html">Mass 
			Calibration</a>, <a href="Tuning_GO.html">Gain Optimization</a>, and <a href="Tuning_SAF.html">
			Source and Analyzer Focus</a> are displayed within the information section. This area also 
			displays the pass/fail status of the test.</li>

		<li class="content_text"><strong>Instrument Parameters</strong>
		<ul style="list-style-type:none">
			<li class="content_text">The instrument parameters table shows the hardware conditions that

			formula information, the M and M+1 masses will be searched for in the raw data collection. The

			<ul>
				<li class="content_text">Formula</li>
				<li class="content_text">M and M+1 values</li>
				<li class="content_text">Observed isotopic mass for each M and M+1</li>

				<li class="content_text">Numeric difference and percent error of observed ratio to

			</ul>

			<li class="content_text">The details section also contains a table describing the resolution, 
			intensity, and intensity ratio (with respect to m/z 69) of all masses from the mass calibration 
			table. This table, like the isotopic pattern table, will display information from the most 
			recent report.</li>
