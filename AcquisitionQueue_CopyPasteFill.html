	<h1>Acquisition Queue: Streamline Building Large Sequences</h1>
	
	
	<h3>Copy Text from a Spreadsheet into the Acquisition Queue</h3>
	<p class="content_text">Any of the columns in the acquisition queue that accept plain text as 
	values can be copy & pasted into from a spread sheet application.  Columns that fit this criteria 
	are Type, Name, Vial and Repetitions.  When attempting to create a large sequence with complex 
	sample names, it can often be easier, faster, and more accurate to generate the sample names 
	using spreadsheet formulas then paste into the acquisition queue.  The video below demonstrates 
	this.</p>

	<h3>Filling a Method to all Selected Rows</h3>
	<p class="content_text">Columns that only accept linked objects such as methods or folders 
	cannot be copy & pasted.  To propagate a method or folder name across many selected cells 
	use the fill command.  This function is accessed via the acquisition queue right click menu.  
	The following video shows how to fill a method across all selected cells.</p>

	<h3>Filling the Vial Numbering & Repetitions</h3>
	<p class="content_text">When filling into the repetitions column you are prompted to input an 
	integer to fill across all selected cells.  The value from the 1st selected column will the 
	starting value from this prompt, however this value is editable.  The Vial Numbering fill feature 
	prompts for the starting vial number as well as the increment value. The video below provides 
	a demonstration of both these filling features.</p>
