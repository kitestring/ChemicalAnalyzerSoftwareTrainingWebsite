	<h1>Library Searching: Spectral Similarity</h1>
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p class="content_text">Spectral Similarity Search attempts to associate a sample peak to a library entry 
	by comparing their spectra.</p>

		<i>Spectral Similarity Searching Parameters for 1D & GCxGC Samples</i>
		<p></p>
		
		<ul>
			<li class="content_text"><strong>Maximum Results</strong>: Defines the maximum number of library hits ChromaTOF will 
			generate for each analyte found and added to the peak table.</li>
			
			<li class="content_text"><strong>Minimum & Maximum mass to library search</strong>: Establishes the m/z range ChromaTOF 
			will include in the spectral comparison of an unknown specturm to a library specturm.</li>
			
			<li class="content_text"><strong>Minimum & Maximum molecular weight allowed</strong>: Filters the pool of 
			library hits based upon the defined AMU range.</li>
			
			<li class="content_text"><strong>Relative abundance threshold (0-998)</strong>: Clears all spectral data
			below the defined relative abundance threshold.  This is threshold is applied to the peak true for the purpose
			of reducing noise.</li>
			
			<li class="content_text"><strong>Minimum similarity for matches (0-999)</strong>: The lowest similarity 
			value that an unknown mass spectrum relative to a library hit must have for that library hit to be 
			included in the hit table.</li>
			
			<li class="content_text"><strong>Minimum similarity before hit is assigned (0-999)</strong>: The lowest similarity value 
			that an unknown mass spectrum relative to the best library hit must have for an automatic library ID to be assigned to the
			the peak table.</li>
			
			<li class="content_text"><strong>Add the libraries to use for searching below</strong>: Lists the libraries ChromaTOF 
			will search through when generating a list of library hits for a given analyte.</li>
			
			<li class="content_text"><strong>Retention Index Filtering</strong>: This filter compares the 
			retention index of the chromatographic peak to that of the library hit. If the difference in 
			retention indexes is greater than the Tolerance value, the hit is filtered out. In order to apply 
			this filter, retention indexes need to be calculated for the sample peaks. If this filter is 
			enabled and the peak does not have a retention index, or there is not a comparable library hit 
			retention index, the hit is retained (not filtered out) because a comparison could not be made.</li>
			<ul>
				<li class="content_text"><strong>Filter by Retention Index (check box)</strong>: Enables or disables 
				the retention index filter.</li>
				<li class="content_text"><strong>Tolerance</strong>: Enter a value greater than zero for the 
				retention index Tolerance.</li>
				<li class="content_text"><strong>Default RI Type</strong>: The RI type, also called the column 
				class, categorizes GC columns broadly by polarity. Retention indexes are more comparable if they 
				were obtained from columns of the same type. During filtering the peak’s retention index is 
				compared to a hit retention index of the same RI type or a similar type when permitted. The 
				software will attempt to determine the peak’s RI type from the stationary phase of the column in 
				the sample’s chromatographic (GC) method. If it cannot be determined, then this default RI type 
				determines which RI value from the hit to compare to the peak’s RI value.</li>
				<li class="content_text"><strong>Allow estimated RI substitution for non-polar types</strong>: If enabled, 
				it will use the library hit's estimated value if the sample RI type is std. non-polar or semi-std. non-polar, 
				and the library hit does not have data of the same type but does have an estimated RI.</li>
				<li class="content_text"><strong>Use other non-polar column type data if 
				selected non-ploar type data is absent</strong>: If selected and non-polar type data is absent, 
				to allow std. non-polar and semi-std. non-polar RIs to be compared to each other. For example 
				if the sample peak has a semi-std. non-polar RI but the hit only has a std. non-polar RI, 
				the filter compares those RIs.</li>
