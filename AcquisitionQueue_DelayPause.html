	<h1>Acquisition Queue: Scheduled Start or Pause</h1>
	
	
	<h3>Scheduled Sequence Pause</h3>
	<p class="content_text">A row in the acquisition queue can be defined to pause the sequence 
	until restarted by the user.  This is done by setting the row’s type value to “Pause”.  This 
	functionality has many applications, one example is after a tune and before the subsequent 
	sample injections.  It is recommend to review the <a href="Tuning_TV.html.html">tune results</a> 
	prior to acquiring data.</p>

	<h3>Hold Sequence Until...</h3>
	<p class="content_text">By setting a row’s type value to “Delay” the sequence will wait to 
	begin until a specified time.  This tool can decrease instrument down time.  By setting a 
	delay to 1 hour prior to the time you arrive in the lab then queuing an Auto-Tune, the 
	instrument will be tuned and ready to run samples when you get to the lab in the morning.  
	After setting a row’s type value to “Delay” ChromaTOF will prompt for when the following row 
	in the queue should begin acquiring.  The specified time will be displayed in the “Resume 
	Time” column of the acquisition queue.</p>
