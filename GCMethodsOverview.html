	<h3>Introduction</h3>

	how to complete them to create a Chromatograph Method. Depending on the hardware selected, different areas 
	of the worksheet are active. Parameter values entered in one area of the worksheet may activate or inactivate 
	other areas of the worksheet. Most pages of the worksheet now have an indication light (red, yellow, or green) 
	and corresponding text box at the top. The text box will give additional information to explain the indication light.
