	<ul>
		<li class="content_text"><strong>Synchronize Total Run Time To Chromatographic Method</strong>: 
		If selected the MS Method run time will be determined by the GC Method run time.</li>
		
		<li class="content_text"><strong>Total Time</strong>: The length of time it take the last compound 
		of interest to reach the detector. If the Synchronize Total Run Time To Chromatographic Method 
		checkbox is selected, this parameter will not be selectable.</li>
		
		<li class="content_text"><strong>Acquisition Delay</strong>: the length of time from injection 
		until the data system will start sorting data from the mass spectrometer.</li>
		
		<li class="content_text"><strong>Acquisition Rate (<sup>Spectra</sup>/<sub>Second</sub>)</strong>: The Recommended 
		Acquisition Rate is based on providing 12 spectra across the FWHH of the chromatographic peak.  
		In a 1D sample, a typical FWHH is roughly 1.2 seconds, in that case an optimal Acquisition Rate 
		is 10 <sup>Spectra</sup>/<sub>Second</sub>.  Alternatively, in a GCxGC sample where peak FWHH are 
		much sharper one can expect a value of 0.06 seconds.  Therefore, an appropriate Acquisition Rate 
		in a GCxGC sample is 200 <sup>Spectra</sup>/<sub>Second</sub>.  To calculate the optimal 
		Acquisition Rate determine the FWHH of the sharpest peaks in the sample, then apply it to the 
		formula below:

		<li class="content_text"><strong>Mass Range</strong>: This is the range between the lowest and 
		highest mass-to-charge ratios that the mass spectrometer will measure.  The most recent mass 
		calibration tune results will determine the maximum mass based on the specified extraction 
		frequency.  The allowed range is from 10 - 1500 <sup>m</sup>/<sub>z</sub>.</li>
		
		<li class="content_text"><strong>Extraction Frequency (kHz)</strong>: Repetition frequency of 
		extraction pulses in the orthogonal accelerator.  More simply put, the rate that ions from the 
		injected sample are forced out of the source and into the mass analyzer.</li>
		
		<li class="content_text"><strong>Optimized Detector Voltage</strong>: used by default and is highly 
		recommended, however the voltage can be manually tweaked by setting the Relative Detector Voltage. 
		This will define an offset used to adjust the voltage up or down from the most recent tuned detector 
		voltage whenever samples are run with this method.  If a Relative Detector Voltage is used a 
		<a href="Tuning_DM.html">Detector Measurement</a> must be appended to the tuning procedure.
		
		<p class="content_text"><strong>CAUTION</strong></p>
		<ul style="list-style-type:none">
			<li class="content_text">The relative detector voltage should be used only by experienced 
			users. Increasing the voltage will shorten detector life proportionally without necessarily 
			improving detection limits to the same degree. Avoid extreme values in either directionâ€”
			lowering the value may result in signals not being detected and raising the value may result 
			in saturation in addition to accelerating detector aging.</li>
			<li class="content_text">The tuned detector voltage is shared by all methods. If gain 
			optimization is run on any of the methods and changes the tuned detector voltage they all 
			share, a detector measurement should be run on all the methods that have a non-zero relative 
			detector voltage to verify the existing relative detector voltage is still appropriate with 
			the new tuned detector voltage.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		
		<li class="content_text"><strong>Sync Filament Schedule with Acquisition Delay</strong>:
		<ul style="list-style-type:none">
			<li class="content_text">If selected the Filament Schedule will be set based upon the 
			defined Acquisition Delay</li>
			<li class="content_text">If not selected the user can elect to turn the filaments on and 
			off as desired throughout out the sample acquisition using the <strong>Filament Schedule
			</strong>.  By turning the filaments when the solvent or highly concentrated analytes not 
			analytically significant elute to the analysis the life time of consumable hardware 
			components such as filaments and the detector can be extended.
