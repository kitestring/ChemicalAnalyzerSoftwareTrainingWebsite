	<h1>Mass Calibration</h1>
	
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p class="content_text">A mass calibration tune derives an equation for converting between TOF and 
	<sup>m</sup>/<sub>z</sub>.  Using a second order fit <sup>m</sup>/<sub>z</sub> values from known ions 
	are correlated to their measured TOF (ns) to determine the coefficients C<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>1</sub>, 
	and C<sub>0</sub>.  The known ions are derived from the calibration gas, Perfluorotributylamine (PFTBA), 
	and reproducible background ions.   See the plot below for a representative example of a Mass 
	Calibration plot.</p>

	<h3>Acquiring a Mass Calibration</h3>
	<p class="content_text">Mass calibration can be executed during system optimization or after sample 
	acquisition using a <a href="DPOverview.html">Data Processing</a> method.  To mass calibrate during 
	system optimization select Mass Calibration in the Type field of the Acquisition Queue, and define a 
	<a href="MSMethodsOverview.html">Mass Spectrometer</a> and <a href="GCMethodsOverview.html">Gas 
	Chromatograph</a> method to be used.  An example of this is shown in the video below; Mass Calibration 
	is also part of the <a href="Tuning_AutoTune.html">Auto-Tune</a>.  Additionally, it can be configured 
	to run at regular intervals using the <a href="QCMethodsOverview.html">QC Method</a>.</p>

	<h3>Reviewing the Mass Calibration</h3>
	<p class="content_text">There are two options available to review the Mass Calibration results.</p>
	<ol>
		<li class="content_text">The <a href="Tuning_TV.html">Tune Validation</a> report will show the mass 
		accuracy root mean square (RMS).</li>
		<li class="content_text">The Mass Calibration Table will list each of the ions used to generate 
		the Mass Calibration curve as well the associated metrics.  Additionally, the three Mass Calibration 
		coefficients for the second order polynomial fit for the calibration curve as well as the RMS can be 
		viewed via the Mass Calibration Table right click menu.  The video below shows a demonstration of this 
		process.</li>
	</ol>

		<li class="content_text"><strong>Mass Calibration Table Fields</strong>
		<ul>
			<li class="content_text"><strong>Name: </strong>This is a text field intended for easy 
			identification of a particular ion. The name itself has no impact on the mass calibration 
			calculations.</li>
			<li class="content_text"><strong>Priority: </strong>Typically the mass calibration curve is not 
			calculated in one step. Setting different priority levels allows ChromaTOF to create a rough curve 
			based on the most prevalent masses. Then, using this temporary curve ChromaTOF will seek out and 
			find the smaller, secondary masses. These steps will be repeated for as many priority levels as are 
			included in the mass calibration table with priority 1 masses going first, followed by priority 2 
			and continuing through all priorities that have been defined.</li>
			<li class="content_text"><strong>Mass Window: </strong>The mass range around the expected m/z in 
			which ChromaTOF will look for a spectral peak. If more than one peak exists in this window then 
			ChromaTOF will choose the largest one to use for mass calibration. For priority 1 fragments the 
			windows are typically set relatively wide to ensure the ions are within the expected windows. 
			After a preliminary mass calibration equation is generated from the priority 1 ions, further 
			priorities mass windows can be located with better accuracy. Therefore tighter mass windows can 
			be used with subsequent priorities.</li>
			<li class="content_text"><strong>Start/End Time: </strong>The 1st dimension time range to gather 
			the spectral data for the mass calibration.</li>
			<li class="content_text"><strong>TOF: </strong>The time of flight measured in nano-seconds a 
			particulr ion required to leave the source and reach the detector.</li>
