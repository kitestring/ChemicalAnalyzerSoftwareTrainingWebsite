	<h1>Peak Finding vs Target Analyte Finding</h1>
	
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p class="content_text"><a target="_blank" href="TAF.html">Target Analtye Finding</a> (TAF) and 
		<a target="_blank" href="PeakFinding.html">Peak Finding</a> (PF) are the two data processing 
		modes within ChromaTOF.  TAF is a data processing tool utilized for routine analysis when the 
		analytes in a given sample and their approximate retention times are known.  PF is primarily used 
		for discovery work.  TAF is a data processing technique which enables users to search for a predefined 
		set of specific analytes in a sample.  The following lists a comparison of the two data processing 
		techniques.</p>
	
	<h3>Distinguishing Characteristics</h3>
	<ul>
		<li class="sub-list_test"><strong>Speed</strong> – TAF requires substantially less processing time 
		than PF.
		</li>
		
		<li class="sub-list_test"><strong>Sensitivity</strong> – TAF is able to find peaks at a lower 
		concentrations than with PF.
		</li>
		
		<li class="sub-list_test"><strong>Peaks Found</strong> – TAF looks for a predefined set of 
		analytes.  PF finds all the analytes in a given sample.
		</li>
		
		<li class="sub-list_test"><strong>Mass Spectra</strong> – PF provides more spectral information 
		for a found analyte as compared to TAF.  TAF searches for a predefined set of ions; those found 
		constitute the peak true for a given analyte.  PF generates a peak true spectrum from all the 
		deconvoluted masses detected that are assigned to a given analyte.
		</li>
		
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Spectral Differences</h3>
	<p class="content_text">Different quantities of spectral data is generated for TAF as compared to a 
	PF data processing method.  The mass spectra below provides a direct comparison for Trifluralin (CAS# 
	1582-09-8) using both data processing techniques.  The table directly below lists the user defined 
	TAF input masses for Trifluralin used to generate the TAF mass spectrum.</p>

	<p class="content_text">The PF mass spectrum contains all the deconvoluted masses detected that are 
	assigned to Trifluralin.  The TAF mass spectrum is comprised of only the user defined ions listed 
	in the table that was found in the sample. </p>
