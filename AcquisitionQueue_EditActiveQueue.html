	<h1>Acquisition Queue: Editing An Active Sequence</h1>
	
	<h3>Edit the Acquisition Queue While Actively Acquiring Data</h3>
	<p class="content_text">The acquisition queue can be edited while actively acquiring 
	data, with the exception of the row that is currently acquiring.  One caveat, after 
	making any change to an active sequence, the acquisition queue will automatically enter 
	a paused state.  Thus the sequence will not continue after the current row is done 
	acquiring unless the queue is toggled out of the paused state by pressing the play 
	button <img src="AcquisitionQueue_Media/StartButton_CT5.31.16.png" width="15"/>. </p>
