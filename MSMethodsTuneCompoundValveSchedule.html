		<li class="content_text">The tune compound valve schedule controls when PFTBA is allowed to flow in 
		to the source.  The signals generated are used during instrument tuning and is enabled automatically 
		regardless of the method settings.  It is not recommend to allow PFTBA into the source when 
		acquiring sample data as it will have an adverse impact on the sensitivity.  Therefore, it is not 
		necessary to enable it for normal instrument operation.  It can be useful to create a diagnostic MS 
		Method to verify that PFTBA ions are being seen by the instrument or for use when searching for 
		leaks to provide a point of comparison.</li>
