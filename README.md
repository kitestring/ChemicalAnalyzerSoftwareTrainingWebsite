Website Description:

Due to the complexity of the software and the magnitude of functionalities within the Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer software interface, software training is a critical part of every instrument sale.  Historically, we have provided training in three stages as there is just too much information to throw at someone in one sitting.  The first stage is a very basic overview of how to run the instrument and, on a very rudimentary level, process data.  The second stage requires a training specialist to travel to the customer site and spend 16 hours over 2 days with the customer and their team.  In this training stage the customers would be given slightly more in-depth exposure to the information, and some of the more advanced feature would be introduced.  Finally, the third stage would take place at our home office with a 40 hour duration over a 5 day period.  This final training stage provide a comprehensive and in-depth look at all aspects of the software. 

Obviously, this is a very resource heavy way to educate our customers, as much of it is done individually.  An interactive website composed of theory correlated to videos and software screen captures offers our customers an independently driven training option.  I saw this as a way to give myself a method of giving myself a brief exposure to learning HTML and CSS.  I see myself as a back end data analytics person, and not a front end developer.  However, I thought there’d be value in acquiring a basic understanding of how fronts ends are built and function.
